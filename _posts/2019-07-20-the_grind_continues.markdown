Lately the coding challenges have been more difficult.  At first it was a little nerve racking because I'd spend over an hour or two on one challenge, and it was a very slow process.  But then I switched up my thought process, and I viewed it as a puzzle or game to solve.  The longer the it took to resolve the challenge the more rewarding it felt.   Even after I completed the coding challenge I'd like to see if I could solve it a more efficient way with less code.  Honestly it was really fun and felt I've learned more completing one lab that took hours to complete rather than ten lessons that I could easily complete.  I have skipped around a little throughout the course.  Not too far ahead but sometimes just wanted to start a new topic and I'd return to the labs I was stuck on, on a later date.  By then I would be fresher and maybe figure what I was doing wrong.  The Ruby doc's have been very helpful.  It's hard to remember all the methods for each class and looking for the different methods through documentation is what I'd be doing as a Software developer.  I also use Repl.it a lot.  Every lab I do I put it over there and do all my testing there.  Once I get the correct results, I copy it over to the learn environment.  I know I could be using the "Ask a question button", but as of right now I like to figure it out on my own.  But I can see myself using it in the future.
