*The little Engine That Could* , I must of read this book to my son about 15 times a day in the last month.  To be honest it's how I feel about my programming life currently.  Not up the mountain yet but inch by inch I feel I can get there.  Some days I do a lot better then others, but I try and do what I can each day.  Some days I learn a different way then Flatiron like youtube videos or reading, but each day I do what I can.  In the story the blue Engine was making the climb to help deliver toys and treats to all the good boys and girls on the other side of the mountain, and I think I'm doing this not just for myself but for my family.  So far I have really enjoyed my time with the lessons and the hardest part is finding a nice quite place to study.  Looking back I'm glad I made this decision and I think it will pay off in the end.  I just have to keep reminding myself don't just do it to complete it, but get has much information away from this and not to waste time.  Hopefully with enough time and dedication, I'll achieve my goal as a software developer and say to myself "I thought I could.. I thought I could.. I thought I could".
