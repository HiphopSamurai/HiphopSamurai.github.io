First off, a little about me.  I'm 33 years old and have been working in IT for the past 8 or so years.  In that time if been mostly a data center technician and now currently working as a system specialist.  I enjoy my current position, but I feel there is only so far I can go and to better provide for my growing family I thought I'd move into software development.  I'm happily married with a 18 month boy and a little girl coming this September.  I love being a husband and father, and is the best part of my life.  I've been going part time to college to earn my Computer Science degree but it's a very slow process and I'm hoping this is a better option for me.  I enjoy coding and problem solving so I believed this was right up my ally.  I have a decent background in programming and with my busy schedule I took the Online Full Stack Web Development at your own pace course and so far I've really enjoyed it.  I'm really glad I already had a background in programming because I think the online course is not new user friendly.  I focus on each lesson and try to understand the concepts they are teaching.  Looking forward to completing this and continuing my journey to software development.
