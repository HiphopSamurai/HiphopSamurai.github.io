As of today I'm on the Object Oriented Ruby section and it's been taking me a little longer to complete then before.  I've been pretty good doing some everyday but sometimes I only have time for a few lessons or one lab.  Luckily I have time to do it at nights seeing I have no time during the days.  Sometimes I have to review the lessons more then once until it sinks in but still enjoying my time.  I remember there was this one really tuff lab and it took me a few days to complete.  It felt  good once I was finally able to resolve the lab.  I really don't have any big updates in this Blog.  Still just trying to do my best.  I might skip to the SQL section to take a little break from Ruby and just start learning a new topic.
